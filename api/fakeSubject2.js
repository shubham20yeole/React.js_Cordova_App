Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Confederate forces, remains a hero in many parts of the South. Here are some interesting facts about him!

Lee’s great-uncles, Francis Lightfoot Lee and Richard Henry Lee, both signed the Declaration of Independence.

Defenders of Lee often point out the fact that although he was a slaveowner, he freed all his slaves in 1862. In fact, Lee had inherited these slaves from a relative in 1858, and according to the details of the will, was obligated to free them within five years. Lee was no abolitionist.

During the height of the war, Lee traveled with a pet chicken who laid an egg under his cot every morning.

Lee was personally opposed to secession, but felt obligated to fight on behalf of his home state, Virginia.

After his army was defeated at Gettysburg, Lee rode out to meet his troops, and told them, “This is all my fault.” He even sent a letter of resignation to Confederate President Jefferson Davis after the defeat, but Davis kept him on.

By the fall of 1864, the tide of the Civil War had turned decisively against the South. Ulysses S. Grant’s most trusted general, William Tecumseh Sherman, had just captured the Southern city of Atlanta, GA. and the two leaders devised a plan to break the South both physically and psychologically.

The first part of their plan was to continue to capture Southern cities and ports. But they’d also demonstrate to the Southern people that if they kept on fighting, they would be destroyed by the Union’s superior power.

In what is now known as Sherman’s March to the Sea, Sherman’s men marched out of Atlanta in November and soon fanned out to form a column 60 miles wide. Basically, they wrecked everything in their path, cutting a huge swath of destruction until they reached the port city of Savannah—300 miles away—in December.

Along the way, Sherman’s men destroyed the railroad lines that connected Savannah with the rest of the Deep South, making a huge impact on Confederate commerce and transportation. And they killed livestock and burned crops, so that Southerners would have no food.

The campaign worked, to devastating effect; four months after Savannah fell, the war was over.

Stockbrokers are professionals who buy and sell shares and other securities on behalf of investors. TV and movies have created an ugly stereotype of what stockbrokers are like. In reality, they work extremely hard at their jobs, sacrificing much of their free time to keep pace with the ups and downs of the market.

If you’re interested in becoming a stockbroker, you should begin by taking as many courses in math, economics, and business as you can. If possible, ask a parent or guardian if they’ll let you manage a small stock portfolio in their name (they’ll need to sign off on it as long as you’re under 18).

If that’s not an option, try to follow the ups and downs of various stocks on the Internet or the business section of your local newspaper. You can also join an investment club that invests jointly in different stocks and commodities.

In college, you’ll want to major in business or economics. When you graduate, you can go to work immediately for a brokerage firm. Entry-level positions are demanding, but you’ll get priceless on-the-job training for your career.

You’ll also need to pass the General Securities Registered Representative Examination, known as the Series 7 exam, in order to legally trade stocks. Fortunately, most brokerage firms prepare their employees to take this test. When you pass, you’ll officially be a stockbroker!

The financial benefits of being a stockbroker can be very rewarding—or not. That’s because your take-home pay is a direct product of your sales! You’ll need a strong stomach for risk to be a stockbroker, but if you can handle the ups and downs, you could potentially make a lot of money.

Civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an inspirational man. Here are some quotations attributed to him!

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”

“If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. And if we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong.”

“We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.”

“Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.”

“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”

“Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.”

During the early 1960s, Birmingham, Alabama was one of the most segregated, or racially separated, cities in America. Only 10 percent of the African-American community was registered to vote, and African Americans were barred from holding most jobs.

When Fred Shuttlesworth, a local minister, began challenging the legality of the city’s policies, his home and church were bombed, he was jailed, and his petitions were literally thrown into the trash by the mayor. So Shuttlesworth contacted Dr. King, who quickly moved into the city.

Dr. King’s strategy involved confronting the Birmingham establishment with non-violent tactics such as sit-ins, boycotts, voter registration drives, and marches. The city’s commissioner of public safety, Bull Connor, was notorious for using excessive force to enforce segregation laws. King hoped that Connor would overreact to their campaign. If he did, and the media took notice, the whole world would see the brutal injustice of Southern segregation.

Connor did exactly that. Over the course of a few weeks in May 1963, he filled the Birmingham jail with thousands of civil rights protestors, including Dr. King (pictured). When the jail was full, Connor began clearing protestors—many of whom were children—off the streets with high-pressure fire hoses. He also unleashed fierce police dogs on them.

As King predicted, the media took notice, and images of the violence appeared in newspapers, magazines, and on TV across the globe. Still, the protestors kept coming. Faced with a crisis, the leaders of Birmingham had no choice but to meet the demands of the civil rights movement. It was a defining moment in American history.
