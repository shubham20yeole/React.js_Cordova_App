When a new building, bridge, dam, or road is being constructed, its boundaries must be clearly determined and marked off before construction begins. And all features of the land on which the new project is built must be measured in order to make sure the new structure is safe and legal. The people who perform these tasks are called surveyors, and measuring angles is a big part of their job!

If you’re interested in pursuing surveying as a career, start by taking as much math as you can. You’ll need to know all the algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus you can cram into your head! Next, find a college with a good program in surveying or civil engineering, and study hard! You’ll want to be trained in how global positioning system (GPS) technology works—and definitely try to do an internship one summer if you can.

After you get your bachelor’s degree, you’ll have to take a state or federal licensing exam. If you pass, you’ll become a surveyor-in-training, where you’ll work alongside experienced surveyors. Then, you’ll have to take two more exams: one administered by the federal government, and another given by the state or province in which you wish to work.

It’s a long process, but it pays off—wherever new construction is going on, surveyors are in demand! You can expect to make a salary of at least $45,000 in your first year as a surveyor, and even more once you have experience!`

Today, ships use Global Positioning Systems (GPS) devices to navigate the oceans. But from the 18th through 20th centuries, ship navigators had to use a device called a sextant to find their latitude (north or south location).

Here’s how it worked: To find your latitude, you had to measure the angle between the sun and the horizon at 12:00 noon. To do that, you’d pull out your sextant, which consisted of two mirrors. One of these mirrors was semi-transparent—you could see through it. The other was attached to a movable arm.

You’d look through the eyepiece and adjust your view so that the horizon was lined up exactly with the semi-transparent mirror. Then, you’d move the arm around until the second mirror reflected the sun onto the first mirror. When you had the sun and the horizon lined up perfectly, you’d check the angle of the movable arm, which was marked off with numbered angles (a lot like the protractor you use in geometry!).

Believe it or not, this setup was incredibly precise; it allowed you to measure angles to the nearest sixth of a degree. Once you measured your angle, you had to pull out an almanac or table and check what line of latitude the sun was supposed to lie directly over that day. You’d do some calculations, and before you knew it, you would have used your angle to determine your precise latitude.

Measuring longitude was a little bit more difficult. For more information on how that was done, check out the Latitude and Longitude FYI.

Have you ever wondered why things at warehouse clubs—like Costco and BJ’s—and discount stores—like Target—cost less than things at other stores?

Most other stores mark up the prices of their goods by two or three times what they pay. The extra money they charge you goes to pay the rent (or mortgage) on the store itself; the wages of the store’s managers and employees; and dozens more of the expenses it takes to run a store and turn a profit.

The prices you pay in a regular store are called retail prices. Warehouse stores, however, sell things at only a slight markup over goods’ wholesale prices. An item’s wholesale price is the amount that a retail store—any store that a consumer can buy stuff at—pays to get it from a supplier.

Wholesalers tend to sell their items in bulk, since retailers need lots of items in order to keep their shelves stocked. Since wholesalers sell so many items at once, they can make still a profit by selling their items at low prices.

Warehouse stores sell bulk-purchased goods at a very small markup. Often, they sell goods to other small businesses, who then mark them up and sell them at retail price. They make their profit by running a no-frills operation (that’s why they often look and feel like warehouses), and sometimes by charging customers an annual fee to buy goods at lower prices.

How good are you at comparison shopping? If you are really good, you may be eligible to win thousands in cash and valuable prizes on a game show! (Or, at the very least, you will be eligible once you turn 18.)

If you’re in Southern California, you might want to try out for The Price is Right. This staple of daytime TV has been on the air since the 1960s, making it the longest-running game show in the history of American television!

If you make it to the show’s “Contestants’ Row,” you’ll be asked to name the retail prices of various products. If you succeed, you’ll get a chance to play one of the show’s famous pricing games.

For instance, you might be shown two items, with a price tag attached to each, and asked to guess which one offers the biggest discount. Or, you might have to match the digits in the price of a grocery item with the digits in the price of a car.

If you’re extra-lucky, you’ll get to spin a giant wheel and guess the price of a “showcase” filled with big-ticket items. Woo hoo!

These days, we take it for granted that charging interest is a fair exchange for lending money. But it wasn’t always so respectable a practice.

The Hebrew Bible specifically forbade the ancient Israelites from charging interest on loans to each other (although charging it to outsiders was considered okay). Later, in Roman times, charging any interest at all was called usury, and was looked upon as synonymous with greed and dishonesty. Cato, the Roman orator who lived from 234 to 149 B.C.E., compared usury to murder. The Koran, Islam’s founding document, prohibits interest of all kinds; it claims that “those who charge usury are in the same position as those controlled by the devil's influence.”

Gradually, as money lending became a more respectable business, the definition of usury changed to mean the charging of excessive interest. Perhaps the most notable condemnation of this practice occurs in “Inferno,” a long poem written in the 14th century by Italian poet Dante Alighieri. “Inferno” describes Dante’s vision of Hell, and a special place is reserved for usurers. They sit for all eternity in an impossibly hot desert of flaming sand where fiery embers rain from the sky.

Later, in the 18th century, British legal scholar William Blackstone penned a subtler description of society’s uneasy relationship with charging money on loans, saying that it’s “called interest by those who think it lawful, and usury by those who do not.”

“Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry” –William Shakespeare, British playwright
