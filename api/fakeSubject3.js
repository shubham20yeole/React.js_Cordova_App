Conveying a main idea clearly and concisely is a must for journalists. Newspaper stories in particular are written differently than other types of prose writing. They usually follow a format called the inverted pyramid, or upside-down triangle. The idea is to start with the most important piece of information, which represents the point (sometimes called the nut) of the triangle.

The first sentence of a news story is called the lede, and it should contain only the main idea and the details that are crucial to the story. Presenting secondary details before the main idea is called “burying the lead,” and it’s a cardinal sin in journalism. If a news writer forces readers to puzzle through a maze of details to figure out what happened, she’s not doing her job.

The journalist then fills the rest of the triangle in with supporting details, placing the most important ones close to the beginning of the story and leaving the secondary details until the end. The headline of the story should also reference the main idea. Just for fun, you can check out the stories in today’s newspaper to see which ones follow this principle and which ones don’t!

Have you got a knack for discovering the main idea of a story and expressing it in clear, concise terms? You might want to consider a career as an editor! Being an editor can be stressful, but the job can be extremely rewarding when a book or article successfully goes to print.

There are two main types of editors: Literary editors work at publishing houses, or companies that sell books. They work closely with authors, helping them shape their ideas, organize their prose, and proofread, or remove spelling and grammar mistakes. Editors at media outlets like newspapers, magazines, blogs, and TV stations help decide which stories are important enough to be covered; assign writers to cover these stories; and help the writers shape them in much the same way that a literary editors do.

If you’d like to be an editor, probably the best place to start is with a school publication. High schools and middle schools usually have student newspapers that you can work on. Some schools even have literary magazines, sports weeklies, humor magazines, and other publications that you can get involved with.

You’ll want to take the highest-level English courses you can in both high school and college. Some colleges offer undergraduate degrees in journalism, which are very helpful for burgeoning reporters and editors. In college, try to get as much writing and editing experience as you can for local publications.

By the way, it’s not always possible to start your career straight off as an editor, especially if you want to work in the media. Many editors begin as reporters and then work their way up the ladder to eventually become editors.

As Tim mentions in the movie, William Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets. A sonnet is a 14-line poem written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic meter consisting of 10 syllables per line. Shakespeare’s sonnets all follow the same rhyme scheme, and always end in a couplet—a pair of rhyming lines that often uses wordplay and irony to sum up the message of the poem.

Many of Shakespeare’s sonnets are love poems that address the ups and downs of passionate romantic relationships. In some, the poet declares his all-consuming, undying love for his significant other; in others, he laments his partner’s unfaithfulness. Shakespeare also uses his sonnets to reflect on the difficulties of growing old, and he sometimes mocks himself for being middle-aged and bald.

Some of Shakespeare’s sonnets are dedicated to a mysterious dark-haired lady, while others address a handsome young man (known among Shakespeare scholars as “the Fair Lord”). To this day, the true identity of the Fair Lord remains a mystery. The only clue is a set of initials—Shakespeare dedicated the first published edition of his poems to a mysterious “Mr. W.H.” Many think WH was the Earl of Southampton (pictured), a handsome nobleman who was one of Shakespeare’s financial supporters—especially since the Earl’s given name was Henry Wriothesley.

William Shakespeare is renowned for the three-dimensionality of his characters and the beauty of his language, but not for the originality of his plots. That’s because he freely borrowed them from a variety of sources.

Many of Shakespeare’s history plays—especially the ones that take place in England—are based on the Chronicles of 16th century historian Raphael Holinshed. While Holinshed was the best source available during the 1590s, his work is now viewed as unreliable and filled with mistakes.

For example, Holinshed (and Shakespeare) depicted King Richard III as a devious plotter whose twisted back and withered arm reveal his evil character. The real Richard (pictured) didn’t suffer from any major deformities, and was beloved by many of his subjects.

Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies borrow from a wider variety of sources. The plot of Hamlet was borrowed from a 13th century Danish historian named Saxo Grammaticus (and possibly from a lost play by 16th century English dramatist Thomas Kyd). Romeo and Juliet is a dramatization of a 1562 poem by a guy named Arthur Brooke. And All’s Well that Ends Well is an adaptation of a story by 14th century Italian author Giovanni Bocaccio.

Blogs have become an important segment of the global news media. One excellent example of this took place on June 25, 2009, when bloggers were responsible for breaking perhaps the biggest news story of the year: the untimely death of pop star Michael Jackson.

For more than an hour, the only place people could learn about Jackson’s death was a Hollywood entertainment blog called TMZ.com. Jackson was officially pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. PDT—a full six minutes after TMZ broke the story.

Newspapers and TV networks held off on reporting the death until they received confirmation from multiple sources. But as The New York Times reported the next day, TMZ “seemed to have sources everywhere—at Mr. Jackson’s mansion; in the ambulance; and in the corridors of the U.C.L.A. Medical Center.”

TMZ’s scoop spread around the Web like wildfire. Across the entire Internet, traffic was 11 percent higher than normal. Fans typed “Michael Jackson” into Google so many times that the site’s operators thought they were being hacked. Nearly 1 million users visited Wikipedia’s “Michael Jackson” page within one hour, while 15 percent of all Twitter posts—an average of 5,000 new tweets every minute—mentioned Jackson.

The event was a great example of how blogging has changed how journalism works in the 21st century. Nowadays, reporters can file articles instantaneously through blog posts and microblogs like Twitter. As a result, the public can keep informed about an event as it’s happening.

But instant reporting can lead to the spread false news, as well. For instance, shortly after Jackson’s death, a fake news website claimed that actor Jeff Goldblum had died. Eventually, people figured out it was a hoax, but not before Goldblum’s name—and the fake website—had spread through the blogosphere.
