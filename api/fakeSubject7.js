Believe it or not, some of the principles of photography have been around for thousands of years!

The camera obscura (a Latin phrase meaning “dark chamber”) was described by Chinese philosopher Mo Ti in the 5th century B.C.E. and referenced by the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle 200 years later. It was first fully described by the Muslim scholar Al-Haytham (965-1039 C.E.), and directions for making one were included in the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci.

So what is a camera obscura? Basically, it’s a dark space with a very small hole in one of the walls. When light shines through the hole, a complete upside-down image of the world outside is projected onto the wall opposite the hole!

The camera obscura works because of an odd law of optics: When rays of light are reflected from a bright subject through a small hole in thin material, they don’t scatter—instead, they retain the shape of the image they’ve reflected from! A camera obscura can be as small as a shoebox (“pinhole cameras” have long been used to view solar eclipses), or as large as a full-sized room.

Many art historians theorize that Renaissance artists used cameras obscura to give their paintings a level of photo-realistic detail they never could have achieved otherwise.

It usually takes a lot of hard work to make a major scientific discovery—but sometimes, coincidences and “happy accidents” play major roles.

Take the case of French chemist Louis Daguerre. During the 1820s and 30s, Daguerre spent his time figuring out how to use chemistry to capture photographic images on light-sensitive copper sheets. He tried many different combinations of chemicals, but didn’t have much luck; he was able to capture images, but they often took eight hours to develop!

One day, he placed one of his copper sheets in a cabinet in his workshop, and was later astounded to find that a clear photographic image had developed on it in a very short period of time. The cabinet contained a variety of chemicals, and Daguerre had no idea which one was responsible for developing the image. He took the chemicals out one by one, and placed an undeveloped plate in the cabinet every time he did so. Every time he went to retrieve the plate, it had developed. Even stranger, when Daguerre had completely emptied the cabinet, the plates continued to develop!

Finally, he figured out what happened. The cabinet contained a broken thermometer, and the mercury vapor that had leaked out of it was what developed the image. He continued experimenting with mercury, and finally, in 1839, he unveiled the daguerreotype, the earliest form of photography, to the public!

Space stations might seem utterly 21st century, but they’ve actually been around since the early 1970s!

The very first space station was Salyut 1, which was built by the former Soviet Union and launched on April 19, 1971. The station was 20 meters long and 4 meters wide, with a number of compartments, only two of which could accommodate humans. A crew successfully lived on Salyut 1 for about 23 days, but the mission was cut short because of technical problems—including a fire—and Salyut 1 was de-orbited, or deliberately guided back into Earth’s atmosphere to burn, after only six months in space. (Sadly, the Salyut 1 crew died inside their Soyuz capsule during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.)

Skylab, the U.S.’s response to Salyut 1, was launched two years later, in May of 1973. The Skylab stayed up in space for six years, during which time three separate crews visited and conducted science experiments. The Soviets responded with six more space stations between 1974 and 1986. The most advanced of these was the Mir space station, which became the first consistently inhabited space outpost.

Like the International Space Station, Mir was constructed one module at a time. But unlike earlier space stations, the Mir mission had a decidedly international flavor; both American astronauts and Soviet and Russian cosmonauts visited via space shuttles and Soyuz capsules. Mir would serve as a model for the International Space Station. Because of its advanced age and a desire to focus funds on the new ISS, Mir was eventually de-orbited on March 23, 2001.

So, you want to be an astronaut? There are a number of ways you can go about becoming a pro space traveler, but pretty much all of them involve lots of schooling and major dedication to a dream that may never come true!

Not to get your hopes down, but since so many people want the opportunity to work in space, an astronaut career is really hard to come by. Get this: It’s so tough that some people who become astronauts never see a day in space! But if you’re up for the challenge, here’s where you should start:

First, take all the math and science classes you can. No matter what kind of astronaut you want to be, you should know about the natural world (and space, of course). After that, think about what kind of astronaut you’d like to be. There are three basic kinds: payload scientists, mission specialists, and pilots.

If you are interested in being a payload scientist who carries out science experiments, you should major in a scientific field that interests you, preferably in the space sciences or biology. Aspiring mission specialists—who perform some experiments but also launch satellites and perform spacewalks—could do the same, but may also look toward more technical fields of study, such as aerospace engineering. If you are more interested in being a pilot or commander, you’ll want to enroll with the military to become a test pilot first.

Either way, you’ll eventually need to apply to NASA (or the equivalent, if you live elsewhere)! The competition is fierce, so you should definitely have a backup career in mind. Also, you’ll need to be mentally and physically fit, and you’ll have to pass some major tests before you can become a member of the club. Good luck!

OMG, it wuz gr8! Catch u l8r!

You know you’ve seen it, whether chatting online or texting on a cell phone. But is texting language good or bad for kids’ learning?

A number of parents and teachers are concerned that the rise in popularity of IMing and text messaging among kids might be hurting their written language skills. Could this be true?

On one hand, more and more teachers in the United States have discovered "text-speak" or "textisms" in the formal schoolwork of their students. Students are actually including things like emoticons (smileys and such), acronyms ("LOL"), abbreviations ("ru going?"), and numeric short cuts ("l8ter 2day") in their written assignments.

Many teachers consider texting language to be conversational slang for the tech-savvy generation. And they consider it a bad habit that could hurt students if, for instance, they use such language in an inappropriate setting (say, on a written exam or in a job application).

But on the other hand, at least one study has shown that kids who use such texting language do not have poorer written language skills. In fact, they were actually better readers and writers than kids who didn’t use the abbreviations!

According to the researchers from the study, it’s possible that wacky symbols and text spellings actually give kids a better appreciation for language sounds, which is a key part of reading. And contrary to popular belief, there doesn’t seem to be any connection between texting and a child’s normal spelling ability; in other words, kids who text a lot still know how to spell correctly!

What do you think?

Ever wonder how text messages get from one phone to another with such blinding speed? You can thank the Short Message Service, or SMS.

SMS is actually part of something called the GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications. That’s basically a worldwide set of rules that allows people in different parts of the world to talk to each other, even if they have different cell phone carriers.

Even when the GSM was created back in 1982, SMS was already in the works. The idea was simple: use the same pathways that carry voice signals between cell phones to send short text messages. This way, there wouldn’t need to be a whole new network just for texting, which would keep costs low. The only problem? In order to fit a text message onto one of these pathways, you have to keep it short—no more than 160 characters.

Today, SMS is just one of several text messaging systems used by cell phone carriers around the world. But it’s still the most widely used—and because it paved the way for this method of communication, “SMS” has become synonymous with text messaging, in general, whether you’re using the Short Message Service or not!
