“I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.”
–Langston Hughes, African-American poet

“Nothing can go farther to destroy race prejudice than the recognition of the Negro as a creator and contributor to American civilization.” –James Weldon Johnson, African-American author

“A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.” –Marcus Garvey, Jamaican-American black nationalist

“It would be against all nature for all the Negroes to be either at the bottom, top, or in between. We will go where the internal drive carries us like everybody else. It is up to the individual.” –Zora Neale Hurston (pictured), African-American author

African-American activist Marcus Garvey was truly one-of-a-kind. Born in 1887, he spent his early years working and editing newspapers in his home country of Jamaica, as well as in Central America and England. And at age 27, he founded an organization called the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Its goal was to unite black people around the world—in Africa, the Caribbean, the United States, and elsewhere—into “one great body to establish a country and absolute government of their own.”

In 1916, Garvey relocated to Harlem, where he gave passionate speeches on behalf of black nationalism and started a newspaper called the Negro World. By 1920, more than a million people had joined the UNIA, and Garvey’s speeches drew many spectators to New York’s Madison Square Garden. The UNIA began a series of commercial endeavors, including a shipping line called the Black Star Line, and a corporation designed to place black-owned factories in American industrial centers.

Garvey also sought to develop the African nation of Liberia—a nation founded by freed American slaves in 1847—as the future homeland of his followers. Unfortunately, Garvey’s efforts attracted the attention of the federal government, which viewed him as an “agitator.” He was put on trial for mail fraud, sentenced to five years in federal prison, and eventually deported back to Jamaica. He continued to work toward his goal of a home country for all black people until his death in 1940.

Here are some quotations from Leonardo da Vinci!

“While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.”

“Painting is poetry which is seen and not heard, and poetry is a painting which is heard but not seen.”

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”

“A bird is an instrument working according to a mathematical law, which instrument it is within the capacity of man to reproduce, with all its movements.”

“As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.”

"Although nature commences with reason and ends in experience it is necessary for us to do the opposite, that is to commence with experience and from this to proceed to investigate the reason."

"In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes; so with present time."

"Once you have tasted flight you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return."

How did Renaissance painters like Leonardo mix their colors? It was a complicated process, sometimes more like chemistry than art, and all sorts of ingredients were used to produce the pigments, or color.

Earth or rocks were some of the most common sources of color, but certain metals and elements like carbon, gold, silver, and even mercury were also used. In addition: vermilion, or red, was produced from the mineral cinnabar; orange was produced by heating lead over fire; sulfide of arsenic produced yellow; copper plates covered with grape skins produced green; and ground lapis stone produced blue.

Sometimes, elements had to be mixed with substances like vinegar, honey, or even urine! Once a pigment was produced, it was mixed with a medium that would keep it from flaking off or dissolving.

For a long time, the most common medium was egg, but later media included nut oils and beeswax. Some artists even used ground glass in their paints to make the colors glow!

As computer-generated imagery (CGI) becomes more and more prevalent in movies, some actors have openly worried that they’ll be replaced by computer programs that don’t age, don’t charge millions of dollars for their services, and don’t argue with film directors.

So far, they have nothing to worry about. But there is one actor who has become famous for creating two very popular computer-generated characters.

His name is Andy Serkis, and he's the British actor who played Gollum in theLord of the Rings trilogy. He also played King Kong in the 2005 remake of the classic film of the same name.

Both roles required Serkis to don what’s called a motion capture suit. That’s a tight-fitting body suit that’s outfitted with numerous reflective or magnetic sensors.

ForLord of the Rings, Serkis performed all of Gollum’s movements inside the suit. Programmers then linked these movements to a computer-generated “puppet,” using the sensors as guides. Finally, a team of 18 animators filled in the character’s physical look and facial expressions.

For King Kong, director Peter Jackson went one step further. Jackson placed 132 digital markers on Serkis’s face, allowing his every expression to be digitally captured and then linked to the face of a giant CGI gorilla.

Some people have criticized Serkis, claiming that his performances aren’t really “acting,” but he disagrees. To make his Kong as realistic as possible, he spent two months hanging out with gorillas in a London zoo and then traveled to Africa to interact with them in the wild!

Have a lot of time on your hands? Looking for a hobby to eat up the hours? If you’re artistically inclined, you may be interested in becoming an ASCII artist.

ASCII art is computer imagery composed entirely of standard keyboard characters. That means the alphabet, numbers, brackets, slashes, and all the other symbols on the computer keyboard.

ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, was developed in 1963. Only a few years later, in 1966, a computer artist named Kenneth Knowlton created the first ASCII art.

Some of the simplest pieces of ASCII art are the emoticons you use to liven up your instant messages, like ;-). But it can get way more complex than that. From images of cartoon characters to a version of Star Wars: Episode IV done entirely in ASCII art! Just look up “ASCII art” in a search engine and you’ll see how involved it can get.

Manually producing a nice looking ASCII image can take days of work, but if you can’t spare that kind of time, there are freeware programs that automatically convert photographs into ASCII images. But where’s the fun in that?
