You might not realize it, but many celebrities and athletes have asthma! As they’ve proven, asthma can’t prevent you from winning the Super Bowl or an Academy Award. It can’t even prevent you from becoming President of the United States!

Here are some famous people with asthma:

Ludwig van Beethoven, composer

Jerome Bettis, professional football player

Coolio, rapper

Alice Cooper, rock singer

Charles Dickens, author

Che Guevara, revolutionary leader

Billy Joel, singer/songwriter

Vigorous exercise can lead to asthma attacks, but as successful pro athletes like Jerome Bettis and Jackie Joyner-Kersee can tell you, asthma doesn’t have to hold you back from exercise or any other activity. As a matter of fact, athletes have a higher rate of asthma—15 percent—than the rest of the population!

Having asthma just means you have to be careful and stay aware of possible symptoms. Here are some tips for exercising with asthma:

First, discuss your exercise program with your doctor; he or she will be able to give you the best advice for your specific condition.

You can usually prevent symptoms by taking medication before you start exercising.

If you’re allergic to dust and dust mites, you should exercise outside to avoid these little buggers.

Avoid roads with heavy traffic; exhaust fumes can trigger asthma attacks.

Check the weather. If the air is very cold or very dry, you’re at a greater risk than if the air is warm and moist.

One might assume that since humans are pretty complex organisms, we’d have more genes than any other organism. Not so! Look at these numbers, and show some respect for corn!

S. pneumoniae bacteria: 500

E. coli bacteria: 4,400

Fruit fly:13,700

Roundworm: 19,500

Chicken: 23,000

Sea urchin: 23,300

Human: 27,000

Mouse: 29,000

Corn: 59,000

By the way, if you count up the base pairs, or individual building blocks, in human DNA, that information would take up 3 gigabytes of space on a computer!

If you’re interested in learning more about how scientists James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, check out a nonfiction book called The Double Helix. Written in 1968 by Watson himself, it offers a remarkable insider’s account.

Watson, who was long known for his frank, almost abrasive personality, doesn’t hide the fact that the scientific world is filled with cutthroat competition. He is honest about his own shortcomings, as well as the mistakes and failures he and Crick encountered before coming up with their famous model. And he reveals that conflict and collaboration between different personalities play a huge role in scientific progress.

Nearly all the scientists Watson writes about are flawed in some way—they conceal data from one another, they steal each other’s ideas, they celebrate when their rivals screw up, and they engage in other petty practices.

The Double Helix was controversial when it came out. In fact, Watson’s first publisher actually dropped the book after members of the scientific community became outraged at his revelations.

The book also faced criticism from some who believed Watson belittled and minimized the contributions of British physicist Rosalind Franklin. It is often said that Franklin may have discovered DNA’s structure first had her superior not shown her work to Watson without her permission.

In his book, Watson’s remark that “the best home for a feminist [is] in another person's lab” was particularly maddening. To his credit, Watson added an epilogue in which he admits that his initial impressions of Franklin were wrong, and that his negative attitude stemmed mainly from personality clashes between them.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been giving out nutritional guidelines since the early 1900s. Its first standardized recommendations came in 1956, when it introduced the Basic Four Food Groups: grains; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; and a catchall protein category.

In 1992, the USDA decided to display its nutrition guidelines in the form of a pyramid. The shape of the original pyramid, which had six food groups instead of four, was ideal for showing the proportions of servings needed from each group to create a balanced diet. For instance, grains, which we need most, were at the base, while sweets and fats, which we should only occasionally snack on, were at the top.

Over the years, however, many nutritionists and doctors claimed that the food guide had a number of flaws. Eventually, as part of an overall campaign to get people to make healthier food choices, the USDA decided to revise and update the pyramid—and in 2005, the new and improved “MyPyramid” was unveiled.

The horizontal wedges of the original pyramid were replaced with vertical slices of various colors and thicknesses. Each represented the recommended number of daily servings from six different food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, meat & beans, and oils. To remind people about the importance of exercise, a staircase was added to the left side of the pyramid, with a stick figure climbing the steps to good health.

But MyPyramid was also criticized for being too abstract—people didn't know what group each colored wedge stood for. So the MyPlate logo was introduced in 2011, and officially unveiled by First Lady Michelle Obama.

"We realized we needed something that made sense not just in classrooms or laboratories, but at dinner tables and school cafeterias. We needed something useful, something simple," Mrs. Obama said. Many nutritionists agreed, noting that people tend to eat off of plates, not pyramids!

Quick—Name a nutrient that isn’t a carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, or mineral! If you said water, we raise a glass (of water) to you!

How important is water to nutrition? Well, considering that about 70 percent of the non-fat mass in our bodies is good, old-fashioned H2O, we’d say very!

In order to keep running smoothly, the human body needs between one and seven liters of water per day (depending on physical activity, how hot and humid it is, etc.). For most healthy people, two liters, or eight to 10 glasses, is a good amount to aim for.

Anything less and you might have to deal with dehydration or other problems, like kidney stones. Of course, you should keep in mind that about 20 percent of our water intake comes from the food we eat, while the rest comes from actually drinking water and other beverages.

And, just like in other areas of life, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing! In the case of water, this means water intoxication, also known as hyperhydration or water poisoning. This happens when too much water is consumed in a short amount of time, throwing one’s entire body chemistry out of whack and leading to potentially fatal brain damage.

For normal, healthy people, though, the chances of suffering from this condition are pretty slim. You need to drink a lot of water (more than 10 liters in the span of a few minutes) to even come close to the danger zone. Please do NOT try that at home!
