Just how tiny are cells? These numbers should give you a good idea!

Number of cells in the human body: 75 trillion (That’s thousands of times the number of people on the planet!)

Size range of human cells: 3 to 250 micrometers (1 micrometer is one-millionth of a meter)

Average mass of a cell: 1 nanogram (1 billionth of a gram)

Volume of a red blood cell: 86 to 98 femtoliters (1 femtoliter is a quadrillionth of a liter)

We’ve heard a lot of strange stories about cells. Here are some of them!

Myth: Adults cannot grow new brain cells.
Fact: Until recently, scientists believed that brain cells could not regenerate, or regrow. But in 1998, Swedish researchers discovered that adults grow new cells in the hippocampus, a part of the brain associated with learning and memory. Other parts of the brain may grow new cells, too. Only time will tell!

Myth: Flamingos get their pink color from a special pigment in their feather cells called flamingen.
Fact: Flamingos get their pink color from their main sources of food—shrimp and plankton. Both of these tasty treats contain lots of carotenoid, a pink pigment.

Myth: The sperm cell of a fruit fly is longer than that of a human.
Fact: When stretched to its full length, the sperm cell of a fruit fly measures over 5 centimeters, more than the length of the animal itself! By comparison, human sperm is a mere 55 micrometers (1 micrometer is one-millionth of a meter) long.

Myth: Cells sometimes commit suicide.
Fact: In multi-cellular organisms, cells that are no longer needed sometimes initiate their own destruction. This process is called apoptosis (pronounced “ey-pop-TOE-sis”).

Is there life on Mars? The truth is, we don’t know.

Unlike Earth, Mars has no magnetic field, which means that its surface isn’t protected from harmful cosmic rays. Plus, most of the planet’s atmosphere has been blown away by solar wind (a stream of charged particles from the sun), making the possibility of life fairly remote.

Yet many scientists believe that Mars was once a very different place. Plenty of evidence points to volcanic activity below the surface, much more water than there is now, and a rich atmosphere and warm climate.

All these conditions suggest the possibility that life may have once existed on Mars. But does it exist now?

Some researchers have set their hopes on microbial organisms called extremophiles. These hardy bacteria and archaea thrive in harsh conditions like volcanic vents in the ocean floor. So, the thinking goes, they could potentially survive on Mars. NASA probes have detected the presence of organic compounds (which all life on Earth is made of) in the Martian atmosphere. This has led some to believe that they were released by living microbes.

NASA's discovery of liquid water flowing just below the planet's surface offers another tantalizing clue. The seasonal streams are filled with salts that make them hostile to most life. But they might make a cozy habitat for extremophiles that have evolved to live in those conditions. Are the Martian streams nurseries for extraterrestrial life? Future missions to Mars will almost certainly focus on them!

On July 25, 1976, NASA’s Viking 1 probe transmitted a remarkable image of the Martian surface back to Earth. The shot of the Cydonia region, in Mars’ northern hemisphere, revealed a geographic feature that looked strikingly like a human face.

Scientists initially dismissed the face as a “trick of light and shadow” that would disappear as soon as the sun moved to a different angle. But another image—taken on a different day, at a different time—seemed to reveal the face as well.

The so-called Mars face thus entered the popular imagination. Various science-fiction writers, tabloid journalists, and conspiracy theorists all claimed that the face represented evidence of an ancient Martian civilization. However, none of this turned out to be real.

In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took a high-resolution picture of the Mars face that revealed it to be nothing more than an ordinary rock formation, similar to the mesas found in the American West. Its dimensions were no more unusual than the dimensions of other formations nearby.

The face was an example of a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia, in which people "see" faces in inanimate objects. That's the same phenomenon that occurs when you think you see a face or an animal in the clouds overhead or when you could swear that an image of Moby appeared on your toast.

In addition to spending more than 40 years in the wild, Jane Goodall logged quite a few hours in front of her typewriter. Here are some of her more well-known books!

In the Shadow of Man (1971)
This overview of Goodall’s work at Gombe has been translated into 48 languages!

Grub: The Bush Baby (1972)
This was Goodall’s first children’s book—the name Grub is also the nickname of her son Hugo, who was born in 1967!

The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior (1986)
This publication was Goodall’s seminal work and is widely recognized as the definitive work on chimpanzees.

My Life with the Chimpanzees (1988)
Another children’s book, this release is an autobiographical look at Goodall’s early interest in animals.

Beyond Innocence: An Autobiography in Letters (2000, 2001)
An autobiography told in the form of a collection of her personal letters. It was published in two volumes.

Chimpanzees I Love: Saving Their World and Ours (2001)
The most recent of her children’s books, this release gives kids many insights into Goodall’s childhood, as well as her early years at Gombe.

Harvest for Hope: A Guide to Mindful Eating (2005)
After years spent studying the eating habits of chimpanzees, Goodall presents her take on human eating habits and makes a case for organic food.
